    "Currently, we simulate the auxiliary parameters provided by a trusted third party using local files. If you want to generate these auxiliary parameters, please run```./debug/crypto/offline_provider.py```. Additionally, you can change the number of parameters generated according to your needs. **Note that don't forget to modify the running path to the root directory of the computation library before running**.\n",
    "In this way, the parameters can be generated as follows: Beaver triples for multiplication, wrap keys for truncation and auxiliary parameters required by four different comparison methods: MSB Beaver triples used in the MSB (Most Significant Bit) method, DICF (Distributed Interval Containment Function) keys used in the DICF method, PPQCompareKey keys used in the PPQ method and SigmaCompareKey keys used in the SIGMA method."

In the ./config/base_configs.py, there are several configurations related to BIT_LEN, such as the ring size (```RING_MAX```) and half-ring size (```HALF_RING```).

    "Below are several configurations used for number comparison in our library. We support several methods for comparing encrypted data, namely MSB, DICF, PPQ and SIGMA. You can switch between these methods by modifying the GE_TYPE configuration. We divide the comparison methods into two types: MSB-based and FSS-based. DICF, PPQ and SIGMA belong to the FSS based method. Through theory and experiment, it can be seen that the MSB method needs to use multiple communication, but the amount of computation is relatively small. The DICF method has a large amount of computation, but only one communication is needed, PPQ is an optimised DICF method that reduces the size of the key in the evaluation phase. SIGMA uses the same key size as PPQ but reduces the computational complexity of the comparison operation.\n",
    "PRG_TYPE is the type of pseudorandom number generator. Currently, random numbers are required when using the FSS based comparison methods. We offer two options: TMT and AES. TMT is an exponential random number generator, while AES generates random numbers based on the AES encryption algorithm. When dealing with small amounts of data, the use of AES is considered to be more secure and efficient."
