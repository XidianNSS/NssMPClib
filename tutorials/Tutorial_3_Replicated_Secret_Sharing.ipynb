    "# Tutorial 3: Replicated Secret Sharing\n",
    "Replicated Secret Sharing is used to securely share secret information among three parties, and in the scenario of three-parties replication, there are usually three participants work together to store and manage secrets. The secret is divided into three parts by some algorithm, with each participant holding one part. The separate parts don't have enough information to recover the secret. When a secret needs to be used, at least two participants need to cooperate, combining the parts they hold to recover the original secret. Currently, our models and features are based on honest-majority designs. To use replicated secret sharing in secure three-party calculations, we import the following packages"
