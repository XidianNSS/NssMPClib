    Perform bitwise AND operation for BSS inputs with beaver triples.

    This function uses Beaver triples to securely compute the AND of two BSS
    `x` and `y`. It handles BSS with different shapes by expanding the smaller BSS to match the larger one.

    :param x: The first BSS in the AND operation.
    :type x: BooleanSecretSharing
    :param y: The second BSS in the AND operation.
    :type y: BooleanSecretSharing
    :returns: The result of the Beaver's AND operation.
