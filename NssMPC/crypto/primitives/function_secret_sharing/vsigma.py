This document defines verifiable Sigma class based on the method used for DCF efficiently,
meaning that the correctness and security of the key generation stage (gen) and the evaluation stage (eval) are guaranteed.
The implementation is based on the work of Leo de Castro, Antigoni Polychroniadou. Lightweight, Maliciously Secure Verifiable Function Secret Sharing. EUROCRYPT 2022, LNCS 13275, pp. 150â€“179, 2022.
and SIGMA: Secure GPT Inference with Function Secret Sharing
